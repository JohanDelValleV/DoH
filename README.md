# Determinant of Hessian

## Detection of keypoints using Determinant of Hessian algorithm.
Using the next [library](https://scikit-image.org/docs/dev/api/skimage.feature.html#skimage.feature.blob_doh)
  - You can compare the original image's keypoints with the resized image's keypoints
  - You can compare the original image's keypoints with the rotated image 's keypoints
  - You can compare the original image's keypoints with moved image's keypoints
